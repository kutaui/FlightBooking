# Flight Booking App

## Live : https://flight-booking-kutaui.vercel.app/

This is a case study for a flight booking app.
I focused on the functionality of the app and not on the design. Specifically search and filtering of flights. I also
put emphasis on UX more than anything.

Return Date datepicker and return time slider is not functional because of some misunderstanding of the requirements.
But I figure they are not that much different from the departure date and outbound slider so I left them as is.

I tried to follo SOLID and DRY principles as best as I can, but I realized I had to do more refactoring than I expected
to make the code more readable and maintainable. So there is still a lot of room for improvement.
