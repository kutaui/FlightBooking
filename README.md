# Flight Booking App

## Live : https://flight-booking-kutaui.vercel.app/

This is a case study for a flight booking app.
I focused on the functionality of the app and not on the design. Specifically search and filtering of flights. I also
put emphasis on UX more than anything. But unfortunately DX is kinda sucks because I thought that i didn't need a state
manager because the app was small, I was wrong. If I were to refactor the code and improve DX, the first thing probably
would be adopting to a state manager then probably clean up and divide the code into smaller chunks. But at the end of
the day this a case study and there is always some time constraints.

Return Date datepicker and return time slider is not functional because of some misunderstanding of the requirements.
But I figure they are not that much different from the departure date and outbound slider so I left them as is.
